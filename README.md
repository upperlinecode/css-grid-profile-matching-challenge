# CSS Grid Profile Matching Challenge

Before you can start this lab, you have to examine this mockup carefully, and then answer the questions that follow it.

![Mockup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/upperlinecode/css-grid-profile-matching-challenge/master/misc/superbookmockup.png)


* How many columns are in this profile?
* How many rows?
* Which column will be the biggest?
* Which row will be the biggest?
* How many child divs will there be?

Once you have a solid plan for what this will need to look like, you can clone the lab, open the index.html, and start working.
